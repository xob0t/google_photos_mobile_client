## auth_data? Where Do I Get Mine?

Below is a step by step instruction on how to accuire your Google account's mobile auth data in a simplest way possible.  
You only need to do it once.

1. Get a rooted android device or an emulator. Recommended Android versions 9-13
2. Connect the device to your PC via ADB.
3. Install [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com)
4. In HTTP Toolkit, select Intercept - `Android Device via ADB`. Filter traffic with

    ```text
    contains(https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photos.native)
    ```

5. Open Google Photos app and login with your account.
6. There should be a single request found.  
   Copy request body as text.  
   ![http_toolkit_tip](media/image.png)
7. Now you've got yourself your auth_data! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

- __No Auth Request Intercepted__  
  1. Log out of your Goolge account.
  2. Log in again.
  3. Try `Android App via Frida` interception method in HTTP Toolkit.

- __403 Response Status__  
  - Try intercepting Google Photos ReVanced. Patch it yourself or use a patched apk [https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module/releases](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module/releases)  
    It uses an alternative to google services, and the format of the auth request is a bit different.
